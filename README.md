# Machine Failures Prediction
In this case, exploratory data analysis, model training and model evaluation have been carried out to classify or predict machine failures based on the dataset used.In this case, exploratory data analysis, model training and model evaluation have been carried out to classify or predict machine failures based on the dataset used. This project is a Playground Prediction Competition on Kaggle

# Data
The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Machine Failure Predictions. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance.You can find the data [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e17/data)

# Model for Classification
- Logistic Regression
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
